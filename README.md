# Hilbert

An infinite dimensional vector module.
```python
>>> from hilbert import Hilbert
>>> Hilbert.random(3), Hilbert(1)
(-0.43247976992238885, 0.8620100981834762, -0.2643857772982335), (0, 1)
```
The vectors are
- immutable,
- zero indexed &
- infinite dimensional
(set coefficients are saved in an tuple that grows dynamically;
all coefficients outside of that are zero).

## Usage

Vectors can be initialised to specific coefficients given by an iterable,
with an index for a basis vector or created randomly:
```python
>>> u, v, w = Hilbert((1, 2, 3)), Hilbert(1), Hilbert.random(3)
>>> u, v, w
(1, 2, 3), (0, 1), (-0.2542424276430939, 0.02971336799386176, -0.9666839730483834)
```
Their `length` is the length of the underlying coefficient tuple
and should correspond to coefficients that have been set on purpose.
They can be indexed, iterated over and compared:
```python
>>> len(u), u[1], tuple(c for c in u), u==v
(3, 2, (1, 2, 3), False)
```
They can be shifted:
```python
>>> u>>1, u<<1
(0, 1, 2, 3), (2, 3)
```
Norms and dot products are implemented with the built-in functions:
```python
>>> abs(u), u@v
3.7416573867739413, 2
```
Vector space operations, like they would be correct on paper, are implemented:
```python
>>> u+v, u-v, 2*u, u/2
(1, 3, 3), (1, 1, 3), (2, 4, 6), (0.5, 1.0, 1.5)
```

## Decision

- Module name `hilbert`: `vector`, `hyper` & `hypervector`
are already taken on PyPI.
